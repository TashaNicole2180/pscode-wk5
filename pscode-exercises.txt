// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers 

 
 

1. Start 

2. Input firstNumber 

3. Input secondNumber 

4. Set sum = firstNumber + secondNumber 

5. Output The sum  

6. End 

 

 

 
 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd 

 
 

1. Start 

2. Input number 

3. If number % 2 == 0 

4.     Output "number is even." 

5.     Output "number is odd." 

6 End 

 

 
 

// Exercise 3:  

Write pseudo code that will perform the following.     

 
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.    

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers. 

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers. 

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are 

 
 

Step a: read in the five numbers  

 

a = Input number  
b = Input number  
c = Input number  
d = Input number  
e = Input number 

Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers. 

Add numbers to sum  

      

If number is less than minimum, Set as minimum number 

 

 If number is greater than maximum, Set as maximum  

 

 

Step c: find the minimum and maximum  

 

 3. Calculate average  

 average = sum of all the five numbers  

(a + b + c + d + e) / 5 

 

 

minimum = minimum (smallest number)  
maximum = maximum (largest number)  

 

Step d: Write out the Results  

 

Show The average for all the five numbers    
Show The minimum for the five numbers    
Show The maximum for the five numbers   

 
 

 End
